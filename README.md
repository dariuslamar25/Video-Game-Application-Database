# Video-Game-Application-Database
In this particular system, the video game application has some various demands that are sufficient enough to warrant different responsibilities. With the back-end architecture, the tables for the database are stored through the Washington Server with the Putty application as an ability to access the back-end. This is part of the process to utilize the client-server architecture that is needed to make this application work smoothly. Also on the back-end are the SQL queries and stored procedures that ultimately test the dataset to work efficiently and offer the users options. On the other hand, the front-end uses Eclipse with integration of WindowBuilder and Java to buff out the ability to select, interact, change, and assemble different options based on the given parameters. Essentially, the overall architecture of this project is a client-server architecture of a static host, that delivers and manages the data needed to offer requests that fulfill the domain of the video game metrics for the users to search.
